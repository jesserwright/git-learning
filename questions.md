What does it mean to "track a remote branch"

We haven't talked about branching yet.

Git pull will fetch the remote (the information there) AND merge that remote branch into your current branch.

(Branching is the part I don't understand, I think)

It will try to merge your changes automatically (@). Note that there is a setting that does this automatically
